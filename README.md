## Project: Simulated Phishing & Ransomware Incident Response

This repository contains beginner-friendly cybersecurity projects designed to simulate real-world scenarios, apply structured analysis (5 Wâ€™s method), and document incident response actions. Each project includes incident reports, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), response plans, and lessons learned.


## ðŸ“‘ Table of Contents

### 1. Simulated Phishing Incident
**Description:**  
A phishing simulation where a spoofed email attempts to harvest user credentials.  
Youâ€™ll analyze the incident using the 5 Wâ€™s framework and document containment, eradication, and recovery steps.

### 2. Simulated Ransomware Incident
**Description:**  
A ransomware scenario where files are encrypted and a ransom note is dropped.  
This exercise focuses on documenting the response lifecycleâ€”identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and communication.
